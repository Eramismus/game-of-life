# Game of life

## Motivation

Just to learn go and how to use WebSockets.

## What is it?

An implementation of Conway's Game of Life using go as backend for the game and
websockets to display the game.

```

Open the file `index.html` to run the game.

## Things to-do

-   Add more features like:
    -   pause/resume
    -   A custom starting point
-   Better performance to support larger grid sizes
-   Stress test the backend
